# Proposed Features: Tag-Based Image Grouping

## Overview

While Sus Scrofa currently allows grouping images by "case" (topic), there is no explicit support for grouping or searching images by "tag." Introducing tag-based organization would enhance flexibility and searchability, especially for large-scale or cross-case investigations.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Image Tagging
- Allow users to assign one or more tags (freeform or from a controlled vocabulary) to each image.
- Tags can represent content, context, source, or any user-defined attribute.

### 2. Tag-Based Grouping and Filtering
- Enable users to view and filter images across cases by tag.
- Support tag-based collections, allowing dynamic groups of images to be created and browsed.

### 3. Tag Management
- Provide an interface for managing tags: create, rename, merge, or delete tags.
- Show tag usage statistics (e.g., most common tags, recently used tags).

### 4. Tag Search and Reporting
- Add search functionality to find images by one or more tags.
- Allow reports to be generated for all images with a given tag or set of tags.

### 5. Permissions and Tags
- Optionally, allow tags to have permissions or visibility settings, restricting who can see or use certain tags.

## Benefits

- **Improved Organization:** Tags provide a flexible way to organize images beyond rigid case structures.
- **Enhanced Search:** Investigators can quickly find images with shared characteristics, regardless of case.
- **Cross-Case Analysis:** Tags enable analysis and reporting across multiple cases.
- **User Customization:** Users can define their own taxonomy for image classification.

*This proposal aims to make Sus Scrofa more powerful and user-friendly for investigators and analysts working with large and diverse image datasets.*
